# ieee-cis-fraud-detection

In this tutorial, we’ll see how the wandb’s direct integration with scikit-learn enables you to visualize all the details about the model, data and the performance metrics on your wandb dashboard by using a single line of code.

The datasets that we’ll be using is IEE-CIS-Fraud Detection. The dataset is available on Kaggle. We’ll build our code on top of an approach already available on github.
Let’s have a look at the dataset.
